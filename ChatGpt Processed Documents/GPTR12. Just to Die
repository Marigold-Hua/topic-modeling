just to die
try bleed feel
day day turn season season
long stand deep end
thought leave thought jesus
thought whiskey need
last time catch dream
time time
keep roll dice
done blink eye
find
end line
learn ain’t fair design
do
born life die
loner find owner
fall love over
hold close night get colder
keep forward push boulder
year get older older
much wish told
time time
keep roll dice
done blink eye
find
end line
learn can’t twice
do
born life die
do
do
just die just die just die
don’t wanna die don’t wanna die
don’t wanna die
