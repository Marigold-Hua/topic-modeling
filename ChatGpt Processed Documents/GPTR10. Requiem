requiem 
sun moon  
won't stop  
dance around  
nothing change  
try not move  
fight always lose  
time seem find way  
not same  
miss everyday  
still thing wish told  
can't stay  
why go away  
hope do over  
cry beg  
take someone instead  
not listen anyway  
stairs can't tread  
go ahead  
know won't mind wait  
not same  
miss everyday  
still thing wish told  
can't stay  
why go away  
hope do over
