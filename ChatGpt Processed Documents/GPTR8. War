war
hold let go  
wanna lose baby  
feel get cold  
cant seem reach lately  
turn blade  
every shot take  
love want  
put pride away  
late bleed  
barely hear heartbeat  
break go down  
hold close maybe  
try stay  
old time sake  
wait wait  
feel pain  
wanna go war  
see hurt  
something wanna prove  
nothing left lose  
dont know fight  
tired go back forth  
always something wanna prove  
nothing left lose  
build wall draw line  
look come lately  
broke glass spill wine  
catch crossfire baby  
nothing left say  
have way  
love want  
would stay away  
much not enough  
end broken heart  
run love  
try finish start  
always stay  
old time sake  
see make  
never feel same  
wanna go war  
see hurt  
something wanna prove  
nothing left lose  
dont know fight  
tired go back forth  
something wanna prove  
nothing left lose
