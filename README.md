# topic-modeling

What I Want to Do
* Build a topic model from an artist's discography (lyrics - i.e., topic modeling where there is a second transcription step. Applicable for voice AI and other non-text media that contains words) 
* V1: Create topic model from Keshi's Requiem album

?s
* Best practices for capturing meaning of music//nonverbals? (tone, implications and euphemisms like "tell me how you want it on the phone" )
* Best practices for weighting things like order of the album, song titles, etc... - what carries meaning, how much meaning does it carry, and how important is it for the piece? I'm dissatisfied with the state of AI for this - still needs a skilled human hand (perhaps: AI useful for analyzing human takes and interpretations of art... kind of like what it does not, but directed more intentionally)

Manual Flow - 13 Songs
1. Go to Genius to get lyrics
2. Copy paste lyrics from Genius to text files stored in repo folder - remove labels like "verse" and "chorus" and delete slop sections (sections of website that are picked up on select but seperate from the lyrics) + add titles to first line, which ended up being a good practice to preserve the titles in one copy paste into the chat (15 mins)
3. Copy paste lyrics into ChatGPT & record results in repo folder (30 mins)
    a. Prompt; "I’m working on a video essay analyzing themes in Keshi’s music. Below are the lyrics to 13 of his songs. Please: Preprocess the lyrics (lowercase, remove stopwords, lemmatize, etc.) Group the lyrics by song title as separate 'documents' for topic modeling. I will copy paste each song one by one - the song title is the first line of each paste. Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or a simulated approach to extract the top 3–5 topics List the key words for each topic and give each topic a short human-readable label (like 'loneliness', 'self-doubt', etc.) For each song, show how much it overlaps with each topic (e.g., 60% Topic 1, 40% Topic 3) Explain the results in plain English — what the major themes are, how they relate to Keshi’s artistic identity, and how topics vary across the songs I want this to help support and structure my video essay — so make the output as insightful and clear as possible. Ready to begin? Here are the 13 song lyrics:
        i. ChatGPT started on task, but drifted by the 10th entry - can prob be fixed buy dropping all lyrics in at once & make a clear distinction between songs (like adding a line). I addressed issue by using the same prompt (with slight edits - 13 to 3) and combining the results from both chats
        ii. in the first chat, ChatGPT automatically generated what the text looked like after. Did some more finangling with other chats to get the preprocessed forms of Euphoria, Just to Die, and Id
            z. Prompt that gets best preprocessing results: I’m working on a detailed video essay analyzing recurring themes across 3 Keshi songs. I will provide you the lyrics for each song, one at a time. The first line in each paste is the song title. Here’s what I want you to do each time I paste a  song lyric: Preprocess the lyrics (each song as one document): Convert all text to lowercase. Remove common English stopwords (e.g., “the,” “and,” “is”). Lemmatize words to their base/root form (e.g., “running” → “run”). Remove punctuation and non-lyrical noise. Organize data so each song’s cleaned lyrics are treated as one document for topic modeling. Show the new text file
        iii. Manually added in song titles to top of processed text
    b. V2 Prompt (untested): I’m working on a detailed video essay analyzing recurring themes across 13 Keshi songs. I will provide you the lyrics for each song, one at a time. The first line in each paste is the song title. Here’s what I want you to do, after I’ve given you all 13 songs: Preprocess all lyrics (each song as one document): Convert all text to lowercase. Remove common English stopwords (e.g., “the,” “and,” “is”). Lemmatize words to their base/root form (e.g., “running” → “run”). Remove punctuation and non-lyrical noise. Organize data so each song’s cleaned lyrics are treated as one document for topic modeling. Perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or a simulated equivalent (since you can’t run code): Extract 3 to 5 main topics representing Keshi’s lyrical themes across these songs. For each topic: List the top 6–10 keywords (most representative words). Assign a concise, emotionally or conceptually meaningful topic label (e.g., “loneliness,” “self-doubt,” “romantic longing,” “addiction,” “hope,” etc.). For each individual song: Show a percentage breakdown of how strongly it relates to each topic (e.g., “Amen: 60% Loneliness, 30% Self-doubt, 10% Hope”). Provide a clear plain-English explanation of how the lyrics embody those themes — highlighting key lines or concepts. Finally, provide a summary analysis including: A discussion of the major recurring themes in Keshi’s work as revealed by the topic model. How these themes shift or evolve across the 13 songs (for example, movement from despair to healing). How the thematic content relates to Keshi’s artistic identity, style, and persona (e.g., lo-fi vulnerability, emotional intimacy, youthful self-exploration, romantic tension). Any notable contrasts or patterns between songs. Please format your output clearly, using headings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate. Write in a way that will directly support and enrich my video essay, emphasizing insightful interpretation and clarity over raw technical jargon. Once I paste all 13 songs (each starting with the song title), please do the above and share the results. Ready when you are.
4. Topic modeling preprocessed text with ChatGPT (10 min) - result saved in 'topic model' in ChatGPT processing folder
    a. Prompt: I’m working on a detailed video essay analyzing recurring themes across 13 Keshi songs. I will provide you the preprocessed lyrics for each song all together. Songs are seperated by a semicolon. The word or words following the semicolon is a song title. Perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or a simulated equivalent: extract 3 to 5 main topics representing Keshi’s lyrical themes across these songs. For each topic: List the top 6–10 keywords (most representative words). Assign a concise, emotionally or conceptually meaningful topic label (e.g., “loneliness,” “self-doubt,” “romantic longing,” “addiction,” “hope,” etc.). For each individual song: Show a percentage breakdown of how strongly it relates to each topic (e.g., “Amen: 60% Loneliness, 30% Self-doubt, 10% Hope”).
