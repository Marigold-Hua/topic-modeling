Night
Requiem
Hard to breathe
Every move I make, I feel them watching me
Try to run away, but I can't seem to make a sound
But I keep screaming out
All my body, all the rest, I
Gave it up and all that's left is you
Try to reach but I can't move
Yeah-ooh
Waiting for the light
I can't close my eyes
When I'm alone, I hear it calling
So save me from the night (Yeah-ooh)
Save me (Waiting for the light)
Oh, give me the light
Save me (I can't close my eyes)
I'm closing my eyes
Save me
I won't be the same me (When I'm alone, I hear it calling)
Somebody wake me
So save me from the night
Terrified
I kill all the parts of me to stay alive
Do or die, it's all or nothin'
Runnin' out of time (Of time)
I've been out my mind (My mind)
I can't pay the price (Somebody save me)
All my body, all the rest, I
Gave it up and all that's left is you (All that's left is you)
Try to reach but I can't move
Yeah-ooh
Waiting for the light
I can't close my eyes
When I'm alone, I hear it calling
So save me from the night (Yeah-ooh)
Save me (Waiting for the light)
Oh, give me the light
Save me (I can't close my eyes)
I'm closing my eyes
Save me
I won't be the same me (When I'm alone, I hear it calling)
Somebody wake me
So save me from the night
