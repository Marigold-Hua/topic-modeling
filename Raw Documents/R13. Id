Id
Called you on Sunday
Just to talk for a moment
Think I lost my way
Can't find the words to say
Where are you when I need you?
Oh, I can't do this on my own
I'm not strong enough
All the mountains I'm facing
I can't climb without breaking
Will the life I made be the price I pay?
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhh
Think I'm runnin' outta options (Op-, options)
Think I'm losin' to myself and I can't stop it
All this light gon' make me nauseous
Burnin' up just so all of you can watch it (Whoa, whoa)
Yeah, and this shit is gettin' potent
See if I can feel, then double dose it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, call it livin' in the moment
Pour me up another just to bring me into focus
Three sevens, H-town reppin'
Waka gave me arms, so I could reach up to the heavеns
Had to turn it to eleven
Had to play at MSG so y'all could gеt the message
Got addicted to the masses (keshi)
Yeah, and the money goin' batshit
Yeah, if I want it, I'ma have it
When I die, bury me in something lavish
Sign of the times
I don't pray to God, that's my weakness
I've been playing God, but I'm bleeding
I was doing better 'til I wanted more
Eye for an eye
So, I risked it all for my blessing
Look at what I did for my blessing
I was doing better 'til I wanted more
All of the glory
All of the weight of the world
On my shoulders crashing down on me
But I want more
I want more
