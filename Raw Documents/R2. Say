Say
Say, say it, you do this all the time
No sense in holding back tonight
Can't contain it even if I tried
Get lost in the moment, get lost with you, but I
Can't read your mind
When all you do is dance on the line
Can't read your mind
All I need is a sign
Say the word
I know what you're thinking, but just say it first
Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn
In my arms for a second
Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours
The look you're giving me gives you away
You finally found the high that you've been chasing
Only one more choice you gotta make
I need you to tell me 'cause I
Can't read your mind
All I need is a sign
Say the word
I know what you're thinking, but just say it first
Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn
In my arms for a second
Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours
So close to your body, can you feel it?
Come and spend the night with someone new
Talking with your hands, but do you mean it?
Baby, all you gotta do is
Say the word
I know what you're thinking, but just say it first
Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn (Time, yeah-yeah)
In my arms for a second
Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours
Say the word (Yeah)
I know what you're thinking, but just say it first
Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn (Yeah)
In my arms for a second
Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours (Yeah)
Say the word
Say the word
Say the word
