Dream
She's on top of the world, it's a good life
I get up just as high on a good night
And it's good, right? Mm
She wants flowers to grow in the sunshine
But I run just like the wind in the moonlight
And it's not right 'cause in my mind
She's a dream, the best thing to happen to me
She's a dream, all that I thought it could be
She's a dream come true
But I have nightmares it should've been you
You were all that I had for a long time
And I still think back to you on a bad night
And it's a bad night, it's a bad, bad night
She's a dream, the best thing to happen to me
She's a dream, all that I thought it could be
She's a dream comе true
But I have nightmares it should'vе been you, you, you
Should've been, you, you, you
Should've been, you, you, you
Should've been, you, you, you
Should've been you, should've been you
(In my nightmares, in my nightmares)
Should've been you, should've been you
(In my nightmares, in my nightmares)
