Requiem
(Yeah)
The sun and the moon
They just won’t stop for you
Dancing around like nothing changed
I try not to move
A fight I always lose
Time always seems to find a way
Oh, it’s not the same
I miss you everyday
Still some things I wish I told ya'
Can’t you stay?
Why’d you go away?
Hope that we can do it over
I cried and I begged
Take someone else instead
Not that He listens anyway
Stairs I can’t tread
So you go on ahead
Oh, I know you won’t mind the wait
Oh, it’s not the same
I miss you everyday
Still some things I wish I told ya'
Can’t you stay?
Why’d you go away?
Hope that we can do it over
