Euphoria
She’s toxic for the thrill of it
Bad news but I’m into it she’s all mine
I chase that dragon all the time
She knows how to reel me in
Use me up and she’s gone again, oh my
I stick around just for the high
Your touch is my favorite drug
Fiending for a faded love
I’m gone, all for you
Take me to euphoria, euphoria
I need you in my veins
I crave the sweet escape of euphoria, euphoria
I try to walk away
Cus if I stay, you’ll be the death of me
I know there’s no such thing as a free ride
(I do, I do, I do)
But when it comes to you, I’m down to pay the price
Got me cut wide open, girl I’m bleeding
I don’t know why I still need it
So kiss me and put me to sleep tonight
Your touch is my favorite drug
Fiending for a faded love
I’m gone, off of you
Take me to euphoria, euphoria
I need you in my veins
I crave the sweet escape of euphoria, euphoria
I try to walk away
Cus if I stay, you’ll be the death of me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Euphoria, euphoria
I try to walk away
'Cause if I stay, you’ll be the death of me
