Just to Die
I tried bleeding just to feel it
Day to day turned to season to season
Just how long did I stand in the deep end?
Thought of leaving, thought 'bout Jesus
Thought the whiskey was all that I needed
When’s the last time I caught myself dreaming?
Time after time
You just keep on rolling the dice
It’s done in the blink of an eye
And you find, oh
At the end of the line
You learn it ain’t fair by design
So you do what you can
When you’re born into life just to die
All the loners found an owner
Fall in love with them over and over
Hold 'em close when the nights get colder
Keep it forward, push the boulders
Every year I get older and older, oh
There’s so much I wish I told ya'
But time after time
You just keep on rolling the dice
It’s done in the blink of an eye
And you find, oh
At the end of the line
You learn if you can’t do it twice
You do what you can
When you’re born into life just to die, oh
So you do what you can
Oh, you do what you can
Just to die, just to die, just to die
Oh, I don’t wanna die, I don’t wanna die
No, I don’t wanna die
Yeah-ooh
Yeah-ooh
