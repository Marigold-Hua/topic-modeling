Bodies
I take it you’re leaving
This never gets easier for me
I’ll miss how you promised me the world, and I believed it
You give me your reasons
And they cut me deeper than it seems
No need to worry 'bout it
I can stop the bleeding
Oh, babe, you know
It happens all the time
You give your heart to someone
But they go and change their mind
Everybody wants somebody
Needs nobody, anybody
Used to things fallin' apart
Knew how it would end from the start
But I can’t help but chase the feeling
Ohh-oh, but, babе, you know
It happens all the time
You givе your heart to someone
But they go and change their mind
You don’t have to stay you know
If it’s all a waste of time
'Cause I’m used to having no one
To lay here by my side
Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
Ooh, you leave me torn in two, ooh
Ooh, like they always do, ooh
Everybody wants somebody (Somebody)
Needs nobody, anybody (Somebody)
Everybody wants somebody (Somebody)
Needs nobody, anybody (Somebody)
