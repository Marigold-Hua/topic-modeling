TexasTake me back to Texas, take me back to seventeen
Let me race the train tracks just to smell the gasoline
When we sipped on Moonshine and the sun was third-degree
When I had a lifetime waiting right in front of me
Take me back to Texas, take me back to twenty-three
When I ran from nothing and I wanted everything
Racin' down the highway, and I'm pickin' up the speed
Don't know where I'm going, but I think I gotta leave
Oh, take me homе
I must've gotten lost when I was looking down thе road
But I think I missed the exit
Oh, someone take me back to Texas
Take me back to Texas, take me back to evergreen
Should've never left it, should've kept that part of me
I know where I'm going, and it's where I'm supposed to be
I know where I'm going, and I hear it calling me
Oh, take me home
'Cause I must've gotten lost when I was looking down the road
Oh, I think I missed the exit
Oh, someone bring me back to Texas
Okay, stand by there 13
