Amen
Uh, uh
Uh
Sign of the times
I don't pray to God, that's a weakness
I been playing God in arenas
I was doing better 'til I wanted more
Eye for an eye
You would risk it all for my blessing
Look at what I did with my blessing
I was doing better 'til I wanted more
All of the glory
All of the weight of the world
On my shoulders crashing down on me
But I want more, I want more
