Top-down whippin' in the '02, '02
Top-down whippin' in the top-down
(Hello? keshi)
Where you at? Baby, on the low
I've been thinkin', I don't wanna take it slow
Never keep you waiting on me
Six speed racing just to see ya'
Oh, you can take the side
Where you want me to be, I'll slide
Babe, lemme know when you're ready to go
Hit me up if you're down for the ride
(Baby, I just wanna show you) Wanna show you, I
(All the ways I wanna know you) Want you all the time
(Baby, I just wanna show you) Baby, every night you've been on my mind
Do you like that?
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Tell me how you want it on the phone
And I'll do it like that
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Take you all the places you wanna go
Just like that, oh-oh-oh
Got the top-down whippin' in the '02, just like that
Uh-oh, uh-oh

(Oh-ah) Top down whippin' in the '02, '02
(Oh-ah, ah-ah-ah) Top-down whippin' in the top-down
And it's all for you
If you ask me to
Take time when you put it on me (On me)
All night, but you know that I stay, yeah ('Cause you know that I)
Need what you got (Oh, you can take the side)
And I got what you need (Where you want me to be, I'll slide)
Whatever you want (Babe, lemme know when you're ready to go)
You can have it with me (Hit me up if you're down for the ride)
